## Introduction

GatsBlogger is a simple blogger powered by [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) + [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)

I build this web to learn react.

### Gatsby

Gatsby is a blazing-fast static site generator for React.

[more details here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)

### React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

I use the project [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to get started immediately.
